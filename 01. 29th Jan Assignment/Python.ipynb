    "Python uses a reference counting mechanism to keep track of the number of references to an object in memory. Each time an object is assigned to a new variable, its reference count is incremented. When a variable goes out of scope or is deleted, its reference count is decremented. When an object's reference count reaches zero, it is considered to be no longer in use, and its memory is freed up by the garbage collector.\n",

    "In addition to reference counting, Python also uses a generational garbage collection algorithm, which divides objects into three generations based on how long they have been in memory. Newly created objects are placed in the first generation, and if they survive a garbage collection cycle, they are moved to the second generation. Objects that survive multiple cycles are eventually moved to the third generation.\n",
